Hi there!

WHAT NOW:

You are installing GNU Common Lisp for Windows, 2.6.8
This compiler uses the Minimalist GNU Windows 32 
compiler tools (MinGW32, see below).

IF YOU INSTALL INTO A DIRECTORY WITH SPACES IN THE NAME,
MAKE SURE you use the DOSified form eg:

	c:/Progra~1/somewhere.


MINGW32 GCC:

The MinGW compiler is provided subject to the terms
of the files:

 "COPYING" and "COPYING.LIB"

located in the mingw sub-directory.  The source 
code and updated binary packages can be obtained via 
the official MinGW web site:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

We recommend that you use the compiler provided when
working with this GCL package for compatibility.  

Clean and rebuild pre-existing projects whenever you
upgrade the GCL binary package for this reason.
