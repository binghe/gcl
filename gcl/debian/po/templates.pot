"GCL is in the process of providing an ANSI compliant image in addition to "
"its traditional CLtL1 image still in production use.  Please see the README."
"Debian file for a brief description of these terms.  Setting this variable "
"will determine which image you will use by default on executing 'gcl@EXT@'.  "
"You can locally override this choice by setting the GCL_ANSI environment "
"variable to any non-empty string for the ANSI build, and to the empty string "
"for the CLtL1 build, e.g. GCL_ANSI=t gcl@EXT@.  The flavor of the build in "
"force will be reported in the initial startup banner."

"GCL now has optional support for profiling via gprof.  Please see the "
"documentation for si::gprof-start and si::gprof-quit for details. As this "
"build is slower than builds without gprof support, it is not recommended for "
"final production use. You can locally override the default choice made here "
"by setting the GCL_PROF environment variable to any non-empty string for "
"profiling support, and to the empty string for the more optimized builds, e."
"g. GCL_PROF=t gcl@EXT@.  If profiling is enabled, this will be reported in "
"the initial startup banner."
