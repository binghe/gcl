;;; CONDITIONS
;;;
;;; This is a sample implementation. It is not in any way intended as the definition
;;; of any aspect of the condition system. It is simply an existence proof that the
;;; condition system can be implemented.
;;;
;;; While this written to be "portable", this is not a portable condition system
;;; in that loading this file will not redefine your condition system. Loading this
;;; file will define a bunch of functions which work like a condition system. Redefining
;;; existing condition systems is beyond the goal of this implementation attempt.
