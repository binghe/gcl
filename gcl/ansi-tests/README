This directory contains a partial Common Lisp standards compliance
test suite.

To run the tests, load gclload.lsp.  This will load and
run the tests.  To just load the tests, load gclload1.lsp
and gclload2.lsp.

Individual tests may be run by (rt:do-test '<test name>).

Please tell me when you find incorrect test cases.
