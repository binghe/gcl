2001-04-15  Bill Schelter  <wfs@linux163.ma.utexas.edu>

	*  Added changes to allow the loading .o files compiled
	on -O4 under linux, and also added this to be the default
	optimize level if speed = 3.   speed = 2 gives -O still

2001-04-13  Bill Schelter  <wfs@sonia.ma.utexas.edu>

	* fix the NULL_OR_ON_C_STACK macro for x86 linux in notcomp.h

	* rsym_elf.c (out;): strip off the @@GLIB* from symbols,
	in the base image, since this is not added to .o files
	With advent of GLIB2.0 this addition to the symbol was made.
	This will allow dynamic linking of the raw_gcl with the C library.
	* remove the -static default from the 386-linux.defs file,
	so that links will by default be dynamic for libc ..
	

Fri Mar 28 16:23:18 1997  Bill Schelter  <wfs@marie.ma.utexas.edu>

	in the install script
	* change DIR= to GCL_TK_DIR= in gcl-tk/gcltksrv* and in
	makefile, gcl-tk/makefile.   Plain DIR= was causing the
	replacement (in sed in makefiles) of other other variables
	ending in DIR= ..

	* o/print.d (BEGIN): fix (defstruct (foo (:print-function
                                	print-foo))  junk)
	  (defun print-foo (foo stream depth)
	       (format stream "#<foo ~S>" (foo-junk foo)))
         bug. [with the printStructBufp value being nulled]

Wed Oct 18 00:16:59 1995  Bill Schelter  <wfs@jany.ma.utexas.edu>

	* (format nil "~5,,X" 10) made to work.   Note the ansi draft
	neither condones nor prohibits this.   Normally the , is a place
	holder and there is a argument after the last , and then comes the
	directive.   Here the commas dont hold a place.  

	* fix bv.bv_offset problem... the move to 64 bit machines caused
	it to be impossible to have some structure fields overlap the way
	they once did.    added BV_OFFSET(x) and SET_BV_OFFSET(x,val)
	macros.
	* fix add-defs to make clxsocket.o not be compiled in case of
	no X11 include files found.

	* Many changes to gcl 2.1 to support 64 bit machines (eg Dec
	alpha).  Layout of structures etc changed.
	* a gcl-2.2 beta was released in the summer.
	since then there have been several bugs fixed.  One in cmpfun.lsp
	affecting write, and another in init_gcl.lsp to make sure the
	link array is a string array (changed from fixnum which are no
	longer sufficient to hold pointers).
	* changes to fix for PA risc hpux in the hp800.h
	* changes to unexec-19.27.c to allow MUCH faster saving in NFS
	environment.

	* There have been an infinite number of changes for gcl-2.0

	* GCL now contains a tcl/tk windowing interface.
	 It is based on TCL 7.3 and TK 3.6 available from
	 ftp.cs.berkeley.edu and many mirrors.

	 See the gcl-tk/demos/widget.lisp file for the demos.
	 

	* support for gzipped files
	(setq si::*allow-gzipped-file* t)
	to allow it.   (load "foo.o") will look for "foo.o.gz" if
	it does not find foo.o.   Writing gzipped files is not
	supported.

	* Command line args:
	See the documentaion in the info directory under command line.
	`-eval' `-load' etc.
	
	`-f'   allows shell scripts to be made such as
	==================
	#!/usr/local/bin/gcl.exe -f
	(print "hello world")
	==================

	* All documentation converted to texinfo, info format and
	extended.   Ansi common lisp documentation converted to texinfo
