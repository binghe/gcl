On Debian, for example, gcl can be run and tested under wine as follows:

(as root)

aptitude install mingw32 mingw32-runtime mingw32-binutils wine

If necessary, as root

update-binfmts --enable wine

Then as a normal user,

export PATH=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc/bin:$PATH
export CC=/usr/bin/i586-mingw32msvc-gcc

./configure --host=mingw32 && make
